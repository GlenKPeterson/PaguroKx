<p>Type-safe versions of immutable collections (mostly from Clojure), plus unmodifiable and
    immutable collection interfaces that fit these collections into the java.util interfaces.
    This is a multi-step process.  The Unmod____ interfaces deprecate the mutate-in-place methods.
    The Base___ interfaces add the fluent/copy-on-write mutator methods.  Those are extended
    by Im___ immutable interfaces and Mut___ mutable interfaces which are reflections of each other.
    The Mut___ interfaces represent faster builders for the immutable collections, but
    sometimes a mutable collection is useful in its own right.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Unmodifiable</dt>
    <dd>This is similar to what the Collections.unmodifiableXxxx() methods return.&#160;
        The "Unmod-" interfaces in this package extend the java.util mutable collections, but deprecate all
        mutate-in-place methods and throw UnsupportedOperationExceptions when those methods are called.&#160;
        These interfaces also provide an extension point for making new Immutable interfaces and collections.&#160;
        In general, the "Unmod-" interfaces do not add functionality, except UnmodIterable adds transformation to all collections and UnmodMap adds Iterable&lt;Map.Entry&gt; to Map.</dd>

    <dt>Base</dt>
    <dd>This adds the fluent copy-on-write "modification" methods and is the common ancestor of Im___ and Mut___ interfaces.</dd>

    <dt>Immutable</dt>
    <dd>The collection itself cannot be changed in place.  Fluent "modification" methods return a new immutable collection reflecting the change
        while still sharing as much data as possible with the original collection so that these methods are relatively fast and lightweight.</dd>

    <dt>Mutable</dt>
    <dd>These are mutate-in-place collections, but with largely the same fluent interfaces
        as the Immutable ones.  They also extend Transformable, so you can still be in a mostly functional happy world.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Just about everything extends/implements {@link org.organicdesign.fp.xform.Transformable}.</p>

<p>We want to make it as easy as possible to live in an immutable world while working with existing Java code.&#160;
    In a perfect world, all the Java APIs and existing code would be magically rewritten to use Immutable (according to the above definition) collections.</p>
